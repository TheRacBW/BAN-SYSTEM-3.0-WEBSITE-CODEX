# Discord Verification Admin Integration

## Overview

The user management panel has been updated to include comprehensive Discord verification information. This integration allows administrators to view and manage Discord verification status for all users in the system, with sensitive Discord data restricted to the specific admin user "therac".

## New Features

### User List Table Enhancements

The `UserListTable` component now includes the following new columns:

1. **Discord Status Column**: Shows whether a user is Discord verified with visual indicators
   - ‚úÖ Discord icon + green check for verified users
   - ‚ùå Red X for unverified users

2. **Discord Username Column**: Displays the user's Discord username if linked
   - Shows "Not linked" if no Discord account is connected
   - **üîí Restricted Access**: Only visible to admin user "therac"

3. **Discord ID Column**: Shows the user's Discord ID if linked
   - Shows "Not linked" if no Discord account is connected
   - **üîí Restricted Access**: Only visible to admin user "therac"

4. **Linked Date Column**: Shows when the Discord account was linked
   - Shows "Never" if no Discord account is connected

### Username-Based Access Control

**üîí Security Feature**: Discord username and ID columns are restricted to the admin user "therac":

- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically detects if current user is "therac"
- **Conditional Rendering**: Sensitive columns only render for authorized user
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear Discord data access indicator when authorized
- **No Password Required**: Access is based on username authentication
- **Session-Based**: Access persists during the current browser session

### New Filtering Options

- **Discord Status Filter**: Filter users by Discord verification status
  - "All Discord Status" - Shows all users
  - "Discord Verified" - Shows only verified users
  - "Not Discord Verified" - Shows unverified users

- **Sort by Discord Verification**: Added "Discord Verified" as a sort option
  - Sorts by the date when Discord was verified

### Enhanced User Editor

The `UserPrivilegeEditor` component now includes a dedicated Discord verification section that displays:

- **Verification Status**: Visual indicator with Discord icon and check/X mark
- **Discord Username**: The user's Discord username (üîí Restricted Access)
- **Discord ID**: The user's Discord ID (üîí Restricted Access)
- **Linked Date**: When the Discord account was linked
- **Access Indicator**: Shows when Discord data access is available

## Security Implementation

### Access Control Details

- **Authorized User**: Only admin user with username "therac" can view Discord data
- **Automatic Detection**: System fetches current user profile to check username
- **Conditional Rendering**: Sensitive data only renders for authorized user
- **Session-Based**: Access persists during current browser session
- **No Password Storage**: No passwords or sensitive data stored in code

### Security Features

1. **Username-Based Access**: Access control based on authenticated username
2. **No Plain Text Secrets**: No passwords or sensitive data in code
3. **Session-Based**: Access resets when page is refreshed
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators when data access is available
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Non-authorized users see restricted access message

## Database Integration

The integration uses the existing `discord_verifications` table with the following structure:

```sql
-- Expected discord_verifications table structure
CREATE TABLE discord_verifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  discord_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  discord_username TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Technical Implementation

### Query Changes

The user queries now use a left join to include Discord verification data:

```typescript
supabase
  .from("users")
  .select(`
    *,
    discord_verifications(
      discord_id,
      discord_username,
      is_verified,
      created_at
    )
  `)
```

### Data Transformation

The raw Supabase response is transformed to match the enhanced User interface:

```typescript
const transformedUsers = (data || []).map((user: any) => ({
  id: user.id,
  username: user.username,
  email: user.email,
  is_admin: user.is_admin,
  trust_level: user.trust_level,
  created_at: user.created_at,
  discord_verified: user.discord_verifications?.is_verified || false,
  discord_username: user.discord_verifications?.discord_username || null,
  discord_id: user.discord_verifications?.discord_id || null,
  discord_verified_at: user.discord_verifications?.created_at || null,
}));
```

### Access Control Logic

```typescript
// Fetch current user's profile to get username
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.id) {
    supabase
      .from("users")
      .select("username")
      .eq("id", user.id)
      .single()
      .then(({ data, error }) => {
        if (!error && data) {
          setCurrentUserProfile(data);
        }
      });
  }
}, [user?.id]);

// Check if current user is therac (only admin who can see Discord data)
const canViewDiscordData = currentUserProfile?.username === "therac";
```

### Filtering Logic

Discord verification filtering handles both verified and unverified users:

```typescript
if (discordFilter === "verified") {
  query = query.eq("discord_verifications.is_verified", true);
} else if (discordFilter === "unverified") {
  query = query.or(`discord_verifications.is_verified.eq.false,discord_verifications.is_verified.is.null`);
}
```

## User Interface Enhancements

### Visual Indicators

- **Discord Icon**: Uses `FaDiscord` from react-icons/fa with Discord brand color (#5865f2)
- **Status Icons**: Green check (‚úÖ) for verified, red X (‚ùå) for unverified
- **Access Indicators**: Green "Discord Data Access" indicator for authorized users
- **Color Coding**: Green text for verified status, red text for unverified

### Responsive Design

- Table columns are responsive and handle overflow gracefully
- Filter controls are wrapped for mobile compatibility
- Modal dialogs are scrollable for smaller screens
- Access indicators are responsive and clear

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **View Discord Status**: Navigate to the admin panel and look for the new Discord columns
2. **Check Access**: Look for "Discord Data Access" indicator if you're authorized
3. **Filter by Discord Status**: Use the "Discord Status" dropdown to filter users
4. **Sort by Verification Date**: Use the sort dropdown and select "Discord Verified"
5. **Edit User Details**: Click "Edit" on any user to see detailed Discord verification information

### Access Control Workflow

1. **Default State**: Discord username and ID columns are hidden for most users
2. **Authentication Check**: System automatically checks if current user is "therac"
3. **Access Granted**: If authorized, sensitive columns become visible
4. **Visual Feedback**: Green "Discord Data Access" indicator shows when authorized
5. **Session Persistence**: Access persists during current browser session

### Data Management

- Discord verification data is read-only in the admin panel
- Verification status is managed by the Discord bot integration
- Admins can view but not modify Discord verification data directly
- Sensitive data is automatically hidden for non-authorized users

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- Graceful handling of missing Discord verification data
- Console logging for debugging purposes (without exposing sensitive data)
- User-friendly error messages for database issues
- Fallback values for null/undefined data
- Secure access control without revealing authorization details

## Security Considerations

### Access Control Security

- **Username-Based**: Access control based on authenticated username
- **No Plain Text**: No sensitive data stored in code or browser
- **Session-Based**: Access doesn't persist across sessions
- **No Console Logging**: Access attempts are not logged
- **No DOM Storage**: No sensitive data stored in localStorage or sessionStorage

### Data Protection

- **Conditional Rendering**: Sensitive columns only render for authorized users
- **State Management**: Access state is managed in component state only
- **Profile Fetching**: Secure fetching of current user profile
- **Error Feedback**: Secure error messages without revealing access details

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Bulk Discord Actions**: Add bulk operations for Discord verification status
2. **Discord Verification Management**: Allow admins to manually verify/unverify users
3. **Discord Statistics**: Add analytics for Discord verification rates
4. **Export Functionality**: Export Discord verification data to CSV (with access control)
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by Discord username or ID (when authorized)
6. **Session Persistence**: Optional session persistence for access state
7. **Audit Logging**: Log access to sensitive Discord data
8. **Multiple Admin Support**: Support for multiple authorized admin users
